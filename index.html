                                <p id="author-text">In her short life, Zari has graduated high school and started college at 16, studied abroad in London for 3 months, traveled to 6 different countries, visited almost half of the U.S., interned at one of the largest companies in the world, and set herself on the path to be financially free by the age of 30.</p>

                        <p id="explanation">Glass Ceiling was the name of the project that was done during my Software Engineering course in undergrad. The assignment was to create a job posting site similar to Glassdoor or Indeed, and this link leads to the results of that project. I worked on most of the frontend for this project along with some of the middle connecting the frontend to the backend.</p>

                        <p id="explanation">During my second internship at Microsoft, I worked alone on a backend project. Since most of my prior experience had been in the frontend, I wanted to get experience in the backend. For this project, I was responsible for building a user context stream to keep track of user movement throughout two of the Business Application Group products. The purpose of the context stream was to be able to draw data about the user experience directly from the sites so that improvements could be made without relying on user feedback in surveys.</p>
                        <p id="software-text"><b>Explore Intern at Microsoft - Summer 2018</b></p>
                        <p id="explanation">During my first internship at Microsoft, I worked in a pod with two other interns. Our project for the summer was to create a job recommendation feature for some of Microsoft's Business Application Group products. I worked mostly on the frontend side of the project, but my podmates and I occasionally switched roles between middleware (connecting our feature to the ML model) and project management.</p>
